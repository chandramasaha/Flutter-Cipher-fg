### Description

This project consists of a flutter cipher, which uses a variation of a simple caeser cipher application to cipher plain text into a human-unreadable format.
This cipher is a simple fun project which allows textual information to be passed between two parties or stored in a human-unreadable format.
Ciphered text can be read by switching to the decipher mode and deciphering the text.
<br/><br/>
Ciphered texts can optionally be protected with passwords which ensure that not everyone who has access to the app can decipher sensitive textual information without the message password.
<br/><br/>
There also exists a SuperUser mode which allows "special" users to break through password protected ciphered texts,along with allowing them to see what the password was.
Messages ciphered in super-user mode do not have passwords, but cannot be deciphered in normal/non-superuser mode.
This app also has a desktop application version and a webpage version!
